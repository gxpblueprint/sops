## Folder structure

Each SOP family resides in its own folder under `docs/` and follows a common layout:

```
docs/<family>/
  _main.md      – the primary SOP document
  appendices/   – supporting appendices in Markdown format
  _files/       – templates and other downloadable files
  _images/      – diagrams and other images referenced from the SOP
```
